# README - 2D Particle tracking code #

This code was developed in R by Ian Williams in 2014. It is a development of the code written by John Crocker and David Grier in IDL which is now hosted on Eric Weeks' website here: http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/weeks//idl/

The repository contains a PDF tutorial written by Ian that covers the basics of R as well as the specifics of compiling and running the code.
